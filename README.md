# smart-control
This project uses a 4-channel relay module to control four different output devices: two LEDs, one buzzer, and a 5V DC fan. These devices are connected to a NodeMCU/ESP8266 and controlled wirelessly through the Blynk IoT application. Using the Blynk mobile app, the user can turn each device ON/OFF individually in real time.
